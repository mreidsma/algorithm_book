The statistical approach [to self-driving cars] turns everything into numbers and estimates probabilities. Items in the real world are translated not into items, but into geometric shapes that move in certain directions on a grid at a calculated rate. The computer estimates the probability that a moving object will intersect with the vehicle. The car slows down or stops if the trajectories will intersect. Itâ€™s an elegant solution. It gets approximately the correct result, but for the wrong reason.
