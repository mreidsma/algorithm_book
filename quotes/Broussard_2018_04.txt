Although the data may be generated in different ways, there’s one thing all the preceding examples have in common: all of the data is generated by people. This is true of *all* data. Ultimately, data always comes down to people counting things. If we do’t think too hard about it, we might imagine that data springs into the world fully formed from the head of Zeus. We assume that because there is data, the data must be true. Note the first principle of this book: *data is socially constructed*. Please let go of any notion that data is made may anything except people.
