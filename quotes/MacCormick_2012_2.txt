“Back in 2002, the market share of the top three search engines in the United States was approximately equal, with Google, Yahoo, and MSN each having just under 30% of U.S. Searches … In the next few years, Google made a dramatic improvement in its market share, crushing Yahoo and MSN down to under 20% each. It is widely believed that the phenomenal rise of Google to the top of the search industry pile was due to its ranking algorithms. So it’s no exaggeration to say that search engines lvl or die according to the quality of their ranking algorithms.”
