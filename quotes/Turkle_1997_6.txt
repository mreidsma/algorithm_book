“What is we somehow learned to communicate with them [dolphins] and they proved to be as intelligent or even more so that we are? Maybe they could teach us a lot about oceanography and hydrodynamics. But would we ask their advice about marital problems? As intelligent as dolphins might be, what could they know about the dynamics of human marriage? My point is this: there are certain sorts of questions which ought not be asked of dolphins and there are certain sorts of questions which ought not be asked of computers.“
