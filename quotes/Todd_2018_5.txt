So, I donâ€™t think the goal of critical work on algorithms is to get everyone to agree with our critique or to start using our methods. Rather, I think one of the most important things scholars in critical algorithm studies can do is to try and blow up the narrow worlds of reference people use to design, build, and talk about these systems. Overly narrow and homogeneous worlds of reference are the cause of many of our problems in this domain (on this, see the critical work of Safiya Noble, for instance). So opening up those worlds means bringing in previously ignored voices, like minority groups affected by carelessly designed software, and it also means looking at the empirical reality of how these systems get made and understood by the people who make them. Not everyone who builds algorithmic systems thinks about them in the same way, and too many critiques presume that there is some huge, singular logic that these systems embody. But in practice, there are all sort of weird ideas about the world lurking in the corners of these organizations, and critics can locate those and draw them out, to add to the mix as we try to figure out a way forward that transforms the algorithmic status quo.
