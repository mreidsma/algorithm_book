A model that has no degree of predictive ability—its chances of being right are about the same as the chances of guessing heads or tails in a coin toss—would have a 50 percent fit under the ROX curve.

Seventy-six percent might sound pretty good, but it’s only halfway between a coin toss and perfect prediction.
