 different people use different definitions for different purposes: it’s useful to some computer scientists to understand algorithms in that narrow, recipe-like sense to do things like assess how efficiently they will perform given certain qualities of the data they’re working on. For critical social scientists, this definition is distinctly not useful: we care about things like how technical systems affect people’s lives, how cultural ideas are embedded in them, and so on. The CS 101 definition of “algorithm” (and, along with it, the CS 101 set of techniques for analyzing algorithms) quite precisely cuts these concerns out. So, if we want to know about them, we need to write them back in.
