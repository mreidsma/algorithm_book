“… what people read says so much about them… For each of us, the books we’ve chosen across a lifetime reveal not only our evolving interests and tastes,” Paul continues, “but also our momentary and insatiable desires, the questions we can’t stop asking, the failings we recognise in ourselves at the time, and the ones we can see clearly only years later. We pass our lives according to our books — relishing and reacting against them, reliving their stories when we recall where we were when we read them and the reason we did.” [Pamela Paul]
