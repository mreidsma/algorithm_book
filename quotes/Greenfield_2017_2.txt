“Precision is an index of an algorithm’s discriminative quality, while recall is correlated with its ability to return a complete set of results.””

Accuracy: were all the items identified correctly?
Precision: were all the items known to be in a set identified as such?
Recall: of the known items, how many were successfully identified

Recall often brings many false positives
