..[Dylan Roof’s case] highlights just how much influence technology—and the way technology is designed—has over what people believe is true. That’s not by accident, writes sociologist Miriam E. Sweeney. She claims it’s an explicit part of Google’s design, which “frames the search process as informational, unbiased, and scientific.” She writes:
