To some degree, PageRank was intended to be a measure of relevance based on popularityâ€”including what both web surfers and web designers link to from their sites. As with academic citations, Brin and Page decided that citation analysis could be used as a model for determining whether web links could be ranked according to their importance by measuring how much they were back-linked or hyperlinked to or from. Thus, the model for web indexing pages was born. However, in the case of citation analysis, a scholarly author goes through several stages of vetting and credibility testing, such as the peer-review process, / before work can be published and cited. In the case of the web, such credibility checking is not a factor in determining what will be hyperlinked.
