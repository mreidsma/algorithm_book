The struggle over reclassifying undocumented immigrants was part of a long history of naming members of society as problem people. In many ways, this effort to eliminate “illegal alien” was similar to the ways that Jewish people were once classified by the Library of Congress as the “Jewish question,” later to be reclassified in 1984 as “Jews,” and Asian Americans were once classified as the “Yellow Peril.” Control over identity is political and often a matter of public policy.
