Inquiries into racism and sexism on the web are not new. In many discourses if technology, the machine is turned to and positioned as a mere tool, rather than being reflective of human values. Deign is purposeful in that it forges both pathways and boundaries in its instrumental and cultural use. Langdon Winner, Thomas Phelan Chair of Humanities and Social Sciences in the Department of Science and Technology Studies at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, analyzes the forms / of technology, from the design of nuclear power plants, which reflect centralized, authoritarian state controls over energy, to solar power designs that facilitate independent, democratic participation by citizens. He shows that design impacts social relations at economic and political levels. The more we can make transparent the political dimensions of technology, the more we might be able to intervene in the spaces where algorithms are becoming a substitute for public policy debates over resource distributionâ€”from mortgages to insurance to educational opportunities.
