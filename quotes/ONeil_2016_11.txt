“…we’re often faced with a choice between fairness and efficacy. Our legal traditions lean strongly toward fairness … / so the system sacrifices enormous efficiencies for the promise of fairness … WMDs, by contrast, tend to favor efficiency. By their very nature, they feed on data that can be measured and counted. But fairness is squishy and hard to quantify. It is a concept. .. So fairness isn’t calculated into WMDs. And the result is massive, industrial production of unfairness.”
