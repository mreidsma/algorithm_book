“A refugee from Nazi Germany, ]Joseph] Weizenbaum held deep convictions about the kinds of intellectual values that might prevent people from trivializing human life. He saw these as decidedly absent from the engineer-style thinking (give me a problem and I’ll find you / a solution, no questions asked outside the frame of the problem) that characterized the computer culture.“

Turtle, 1997, p. 106
