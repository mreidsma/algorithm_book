“But complacency is unwarranted. Many of these companies make decisions affecting millions of people every day, and small mistakes can cascade into life-changing reclassifications. We cannot access critical features of their decision-making processes. The corporate strategists and governmental authorities of the future will deploy their massive resources to keep their one-way mirrors in place; the advantages conferred upon them by Big Data technologies are too great to give up without a fight. But black boxes are a signal that information imbalances have gone too far. We have come to rely on the titans of reputation, search, and finance to help us make sense of the world; it is time for policymakers to help us make sense of the sensemakers.”
