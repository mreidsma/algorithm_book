I have been on Facebook and pulled up some folks who work at Yelp, and from my perspective and from what I saw, there weren’t that many Black people. It wasn’t diverse. You can see everyone on FB, and these people are not Black people. And that’s a problem, because how would they know to even consider the needs of a minority of what our language is? You are telling us we have to use certain keywords, and you don’t even know our language, because you think that “Black hair” means  hair **color**, not **texture**! We don’t call each other African American; society calls us that. Do you know what I mean? We are Black.
