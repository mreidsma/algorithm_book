“Users of Depression 2,0 [an AI therapist] do not dismiss its efforts as pretense (saying, for example, that beneath the surface, the program is just rules). For the most part, they suspend disbelief and become absorbed in what is happening on the screen. In the emerging culture of simulation, they are happy, in other words, to take the program at interface value.”

Turtle, 1997, p. 103
