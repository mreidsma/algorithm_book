“The failure wasn’t in their design, but in the narrowness of their vision. They didn’t look beyond that ideal persona, in that ideal circumstance, and ask, “How will someone in another context perceive this?“ The same thing happens on design teams every day: we work from an imagined ideal, both in terms of the user and the user experience.“

Meyer & Wachter-Boetcher, 2016, p. 9
