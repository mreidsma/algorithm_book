Media scholars have studied ways in which the public is directly impacted by these negative portrayals [of underrepresented populations]. In the case of television, research shows that negative images of Blacks can adversely alter the perception of them in society. Narissra M. Punyanunt-Carter, a communications scholar at Texas Tech University, has specifically researched media portrayals of African Americansâ€™ societal roles, which confirms previous studies about the effects of negative media images of Blacks on college students. Thomas E. Ford found that both Blacks and Whites who view Blacks nagatively on television are more likely to hold negative perceptions of them(selves). Yuki Fujioka notes that in the absence of positive firsthand experience, stereotypical media portrayals of Blacks on television are highly likely to affect perceptions of the group.
