Dear Library Juice Press Editors,

I am submitting a proposal for my current book project, *Masked by Trust: Bias in library discovery*. The book is a critical study of the algorithms behind library discovery systems to help librarians, researchers, and software developers better understand the social and ethical impacts of academic search tools. I have been conducting research for the book for the past year, and will be on sabbatical this Fall to write the manuscript, which I estimate will be finished by March 1, 2019.

As this project is firmly rooted in critical librarianship, I feel that Library Juice Press would be an excellent publisher. In the book I will show that discovery systems routinely display results that reflect biases against women, Muslims, African Americans, LGBTQ people, and the mentally ill. While this project is more technical than many of your previous publications, it will not require technical expertise, and in fact will aim to equip all readers, technical or otherwise, with strategies to assess and push back against bias in library search tools.

### Book Description

Libraries have adopted "Google-like" tools, called discovery systems, to search their collections, presenting scholarly articles, books, archival items, and other library holdings in a single results list, removing the need for the user to search individual databases, one at a time.

Because these tools are provided by libraries and search subscription databases of scholarly materials rather than the open web, we often assume (and libraries actively promote the idea) that they are more trustworthy than their general-purpose peers like Google. Although the content may be more academic, library discovery systems are still software written by people with prejudices and biases. As I will show, library discovery systems struggle with accuracy, relevance, and human biases, and these shortcomings have the potential to shape the academic research of the students and faculty who rely on them. 

To date, critical algorithm scholars have focused on commercial search tools and social media platforms, but there has been no study of the influence of algorithms in academic search tools. In 2016, I conducted a small analysis of one relevance algorithm in ProQuest's Summon. In my study I analyzed 8,000 Summon searches and uncovered a pattern of biased reference results against women, black people, Muslims, the LGBT community, and the mentally ill. "Stress" in the workplace was equated with working women, any search on mental illness implied that this was a "myth," and a search for information about rape in the United States suggested learning more about "hearsay evidence." I have continued studying the algorithms of all major discovery systems and have found similar results. Far from "neutral," these systems must be examined to uncover the claims, beliefs, and prejudices they perpetrate that challenge the values and ideals of libraries.

This book will extend the scholarly discussion surrounding critical algorithmic studies to commercial library discovery tools. It will contribute to the critical examination underlying how library collections are searched, as well as how contemporary academic research is done. In addition, the book will present best practices for software developers, instructional designers, information literacy instructors, as well as library managers for assessing, teaching about, and mitigating bias in library search tools.

This book is primarily aimed at academic librarians and those studying library and information science. While the book in nominally about a technical aspect of librarianship, the book addresses the impacts of bias in discovery systems for public service, instruction, and technical service librarians. Rather than requiring a working knowledge of discovery systems, the book introduces the role of discovery by analogy, showing its relation to general-purpose search tools like Google.

### Competing Books

There is currently no book that examines the algorithms behind library search tools. However, several books examine the algorithms behind horizontal search platforms like Google, which offering an ethical critique of the bias in their algorithms. 

Title: *Algorithms of Oppression: How search engines reinforce racism*  
Author: Safiya U. Noble  
ISBN: 9781479849949  
Comments: Dr. Noble's book is the closest in scope to my proposal, but she examines how systemic racism is embedded in general-purpose search tools and search results to reinforce stereotypes. My book takes a more narrow focus, looking at a vertical search tool that is limited to academic holdings, but I also focus on systemic biases that are embedded in these algorithmic tools.

Title: *Weapons of math destruction: How Big Data increases inequality and threatens democracy*  
Author: Cathy O'Neil  
ISBN: 9780553418835  
Comments: Ms. O'Neil's book doesn't focus strictly on search algorithms, but rather looks at how systemic biases are embedded in algorithmic tools throughout several industries, leading to increased inequality especially for marginalized populations. My research also shows that these systemic biases also push hardest against those populations that are already marginalized in society.

Title: *Technically Wrong: Sexist apps, biased algorithms, and other threats of toxic tech.*  
Author: Sara Wachter-Boettcher  
ISBN: 9780393634631  
Comments: Ms. Wachter-Boettcher's book, like Ms. O'Neil's, covers algorithms throughout the tech industry, but she does look closely at Google's search algorithms and how biases affect more vulnerable users.

Title: *Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor*  
Author: Virginia Eubanks  
ISBN: 9781250074317  
Comments: Ms. Eubanks' book does not cover search algorithms, but uncovers how human biases are often hidden behind "trustworthy" computer algorithms, harming already marginalized populations in the process.

### My Previous Publications
