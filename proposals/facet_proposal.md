# Facet Publishing - Proposal 

Thank you for considering publishing with Facet, the leading publisher for library and information professionals worldwide. To help us make an assessment of your proposal it needs to include the following information as fully as possible:

## 1. Description and Rationale

### 1.1 Suggested title of the book:

Masked by Truth: Bias in library discovery

### 1.2 Synopsis:

A critical study of the algorithms behind library discovery systems to help librarians, researchers, and software developers better understand the social and ethical impacts of academic search tools.

### 1.3 Description of the book:

In the past decade, the tools of research have changed dramatically. The rise of Google and its integration into nearly every aspect of our lives has pushed libraries to adopt similar "Google-like" tools to search their collections. These unified search tools, called discovery systems, search across hundreds of third-party research databases, presenting scholarly articles, books, archival items, and other library holdings in a single results list, removing the need for the user to search individual databases, one at a time.

Because these tools are provided by libraries and search subscription databases of scholarly materials rather than the open web, we often assume (and libraries actively promote the idea) that they are more "accurate" or "reliable" than their general-purpose peers like Google. Although the content may be more academic, library discovery systems are still software written by people with prejudices and biases. Discovery systems are subject to strong commercial pressures, which are hidden from users (and many in libraries) behind diffuse collection-development contracts and layers of administration. Additionally, they struggle to integrate content from thousands of different vendors and their respective disregard for consistent metadata. As I will show, library discovery systems struggle with accuracy, relevance, and human biases, and these shortcomings have the potential to shape the academic research of the students and faculty who rely on them.

Human bias, commercial interests, and problematic metadata have long affected researchers' access to information. What is new with algorithms in library discovery systems is the scale of the effect and the widespread belief that these obstacles to "objective truth" have been largely erased from our library tools.

To date critical algorithm scholars have focused on commercial search tools and social media platforms, but there has been no study of the influence of algorithms in academic search tools. In 2016, I conducted a small analysis of one relevance algorithm in ProQuest's Summon. Summon offers a "Topic Explorer," like Google's Knowledge Graph, which shows reference articles for broad searches to, in the words of ProQuest's marketing team, "provide users with valuable contextual information to improve research outcomes." In my study I analyzed 8,000 Summon searches that returned a Topic Explorer result, and saw that the algorithm was (more or less) accurate an impressive 93% of the time. But of the incorrect results, 54 (.68% of the 8,000) exhibited bias against women, black people, Muslims, the LGBT community, and the mentally ill, mostly through what Mowshowitz and Kawaguchi (2002) call "indexical bias" (p. 143) where the juxtaposition of items was enough to suggest bias. "Stress" in the workplace was equated with working women, any search on mental illness implied that this was a "myth," and a search for information about rape in the United States suggested learning more about "hearsay evidence" (Reidsma, 2016a). This research was just an initial, localized foray into examining the role commercial academic search tools have on how students and scholars access and understand information. Far from "neutral," these systems must be examined to uncover the claims, beliefs, and prejudices they perpetrate that challenge the values and ideals of libraries.

This book will extend the scholarly discussion surrounding critical algorithmic studies to commercial library discovery tools. It will contribute to the critical examination underlying how library collections are searched, as well as how contemporary academic research is done. In addition, the book will present best practices for software developers, instructional designers, information literacy instructors, as well as library managers for assessing, teaching about, and mitigating bias in library search tools.

### 1.5 Key selling points:

* **Topicality**: Critical algorithmic studies is a growing field of cross-disciplinary researchers studying the ethical and social dimensions of algorithmic tools. Nearly every day, another story appears in the mainstream press about the effects of algorithms on our lives, from the way Facebook controls the stories we see to the racial biases of facial recognition technologies.
* **Original Research**: Libraries have marketed their search tools as more "objective" and "authoritative" than Google. My research shows that these academic algorithmic tools are just as susceptible to bias and error as general purpose search tools.
* **Practical Guidelines**: The book includes practical techniques to help confront bias and misinformation in library search tools for software developers, librarians evaluating algorithmic systems, researchers using our tools, and librarians teaching information literacy.

### 1.6 Estimated length:

60,000 words.

### 1.7 Estimated date of manuscript completion:

March 1, 2019. I will be on sabbatical writing from August 28th, 2018 until January 2, 2019.

## 2. The Market

### 2.1 Readership

This book is primarily aimed at academic librarians and those studying library and information science. While the book in nominally about a technical aspect of librarianship, the book addresses the impacts of bias in discovery systems for public service, instruction, and technical service librarians. Rather than requiring a working knowledge of discovery systems, the book introduces the role of discovery by analogy, showing its relation to general-purpose search tools like Google. 

There is a possible secondary market in researchers who use library discovery tools for research, or scholars interested in critical algorithmic studies. In the United States, discovery services like Summon and Primo are increasingly being sold to public high schools, which could open up a new audience of librarians.

### 2.2 Subject areas

Please tick all the subject areas below that are applicable to your book.

* Academic libraries
* Library & information science
* Metadata
* Digital libraries
* E-books & electronic resources
* Information literacy
* Information organization & retrieval
* Systems & new technologies
* Website & intranet management
* Knowledge & information management
 
### 2.3 Course Use

This book would be of interest as a supplemental reading in undergraduate or graduate ethics courses, especially those targeted to computer engineering students. In graduate Library and Information Science programs, this book would supplement courses on information ethics, collection development, information literacy, reference, and software development. Other special topics courses that would be relevant include those like Dorthea Salo's "Code and Power" course at the UW-Madison iSchool.

### 2.4 Overseas Potential

Most college and university libraries in Australia and Europe have discovery systems, and so this book would appeal to technical, instruction, and collection librarians.

## 3.Competing Titles

There is currently no book that examines the algorithms behind library search tools. However, several books examine the algorithms behind horizontal search platforms like Google, which offering an ethical critique of the bias in their algorithms. 

Title: *Algorithms of Oppression: How search engines reinforce racism*  
Author: Safiya U. Noble  
ISBN: 9781479849949  
Comments: Dr. Noble's book is the closest in scope to my proposal, but she examines how systemic racism is embedded in general-purpose search tools and search results to reinforce stereotypes. My book takes a more narrow focus, looking at a vertical search tool that is limited to academic holdings, but I also focus on systemic biases that are embedded in these algorithmic tools.

Title: *Weapons of math destruction: How Big Data increases inequality and threatens democracy*  
Author: Cathy O'Neil  
ISBN: 9780553418835  
Comments: Ms. O'Neil's book doesn't focus strictly on search algorithms, but rather looks at how systemic biases are embedded in algorithmic tools throughout several industries, leading to increased inequality especially for marginalized populations. My research also shows that these systemic biases also push hardest against those populations that are already marginalized in society.

Title: *Technically Wrong: Sexist apps, biased algorithms, and other threats of toxic tech.*  
Author: Sara Wachter-Boettcher  
ISBN: 9780393634631  
Comments: Ms. Wachter-Boettcher's book, like Ms. O'Neil's, covers algorithms throughout the tech industry, but she does look closely at Google's search algorithms and how biases affect more vulnerable users.

Title: *Radical Technologies: The design of everyday life*  
Author: Adam Greenfield  
ISBN: 9781784780432  
Comments: Mr. Greenfield's book also covers different aspects of how a slate of new technologies, including algorithms, are affecting the social and ethical framework of our society. His analyses of automation, algorithms, and machine learning show that the social impacts of these algorithmic technologies are often overlooked in favor of their marketable efficiencies. My critique of library discovery algorithms is similar, in that the race to bring more "relevant" results by necessity ignores the ethical responsibilities of the algorithms creators.

### 4.2 Author biography:

I am the Web Services Librarian for Grand Valley State University, and the author of two books: *Responsive web design for libraries* (2014) from ALA TechSource, and *Customizing vendor systems for better user experiences* (2016) from Libraries Unlimited. I also co-founded and served for five years as editor-in-chief of *Weave: Journal of Library User Experience*, an open-access, peer-reviewed journal for library UX professionals published by Michigan Publishing (http://weaveux.org). In 2013, *Library Journal* named me a "Mover & Shaker," and I speak about library user experience and information ethics around the world.

I've been designing and building web-based tools and search algorithms for nearly 15 years, and have spent the past seven testing and analyzing commercial library discovery systems for the University Libraries. I have the technical understanding and coding ability to write this book. But this project will require more than just technical knowledge. Before joining the library, I taught Ethics in the Philosophy Department at GVSU, building off work I did during my Masters at Harvard Divinity School on the intersection of phenomenology, or the philosophy of experience, and ethics. I started my academic career by examining the ethical aspects of human-to-human communication and experience. Given the technological developments of the past two decades, looking closer at the ethics behind human-to-computer interaction seems a natural next step.
